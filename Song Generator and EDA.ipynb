    "A while back, I noticed something popping up on my Facebook feed saying something about randomly generated Iron Maiden song lyrics. I recently learned about the natural language processing in college and was curious how that generator was created. Given the extra time I have due to lockdown, I decided to create my own version of a song generator by making use of n-gram probability models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of making a generator for just Iron Maiden or any one band, I wanted my generator to make a song any artist that you can think of. In addition, I want my generator to create songs that are in the style of certain albums, from a specified date range, or even a mish-mash of multiple artists.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will be using an azlyrics API written by AnthonyBloomer and adhorrig. However, a part of the source code for this API doesn't work, so I will be using a slightly modified version of their API. There will also be some brief exploratory data analysis perfomed."
